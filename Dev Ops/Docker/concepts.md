## Images and containers

A container is launched by a running image. An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application: the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables and configuration files.

A **container** is a run time instance of an image, what the image becomes in memory once executed.

A container runs natively on Linux and shares the kernel of the host machine with other containers. By contrast a virtual machine runs a guest operating system with virtual access to host resources through a hypervisor.


## Registry

A registry is a collection of repositories and a repository is a collection of images.
