## InterProcess Communication

In IPC there are 3 issues: 
* how can one process pass information to another
* how to make sure two processes do not get into each other way
* proper sequencing when dependencies are present

### Race Conditions

In order to avoid race conditions we need **mutual exclusion**.

The part of the program where the shared memory is accessed is called *critical region* or *critical section*. A requirement to avoid race conditions is that no two processes are in their critical region at the same time. However this condition itself is not sufficient for having parallel processes cooperate correctly and efficiently. We need the following:

1. No two processes may be simultaneously inside their critical regions
2. No assumption may be made about speeds or the number of CPUs
3. No process running outside its critical region may block any process 
4. No process should have to wait forever to enter its critical region

#### Mutual exclusion by busy waiting

**Disable interrupts**

On a single processor system the easiest solution is to have each process disable all interrupts after entering its critical region and re-enable them just before leaving it.

This approach is unattractive since it is unwise to give user processes the power to turn off interrupts. What if one process does not turn them on? It would be the end of the system.

**Lock variables**

We could consider a shared (lock) variable set to 0. If the lock is 0 the process sets it to 1 and enters its critical region. If the lock is already 1 the process waits until it becomes 0.

Unfortunately there is a flaw: suppose one process reads the lock and sees it is 0. Before it can set the lock to 1 another process is scheduled, runs and sets the lock to 1.

**Strict alternation**

```
while (TRUE) {
	while (turn != 0) critical_region();

	turn = 1;
	noncritical_region();
}
```

Continuously testing a variable until some value appears is called **busy waiting**. It should be avoided since it wastes CPU time.
A lock that uses busy waiting is called a **spin lock**.

Taking turns is not a good idea when one of the two processes is much slower than the other.

This situation violates condition 3 set above.

**Peterson's solution**

```
#define FALSE 0
#define TRUE  1
#define N	  2

int turn;
int interested[N];

void enter_region(int process) {
	int other;
	other = 1-process;
	interested[process] = TRUE;
	turn = process;
	while (turn == process && interested[other] == TRUE) /* null statement */ ;
}

void leave_region(int process) {
	interested[process] = FALSE;
}
```
Before using the shared variables (eg. before entering its critical region) each process calles `enter_region` with its own process number as parameter. This call will cause it to wait until it is safe to enter.

**The TSL instruction**

`TSL RX, LOCK`

The TSL (Test and Set Lock) instruction works as follows: it reads the content of the memory word *lock* into register `RX` and then stores a non zero value at the memory address lock. The operations of reading the word and storing into it are **guaranteed to be indivisible**. 

It is important to note that locking the memory bus is very different from disabling the interrupts. Disabling interrupts then performing a read on memory word followed by a write does not prevent a second processor on the bus from accessing the word between the read and write. In fact disabling interrupts on processor 1 has no effect at all on processor 2.

```
enter_region:
	TSL REGISTER,LOCK		// copy lock to register and set lock to 1
	CMP REGISTER,#0			// was lock zero?
	JNE enter_region		// if it was not zero lock was set, so loop
	RET

leave_region:
	MOVE LOCK,#0
	RET
```

An alternative instruction to TSL is XCHG which exchanges the content of two locations atomically.

**Sleep and Wakeup**

Both Peterson's solution and the ones using TSL or XCHG are correct, but both have the defect of requiring busy waiting. In essence what these solutions do is this: when a process wants to enter its critical region, it checks to see if the entry is allowed. If it is not the process just sits in a tight loop waiting until it is.

Not only this approach wastes CPU time but also leads to unexpected results. Let us have two processes H and L, with high and low priorities respectively. When L is in its critical region, H becomes ready to run. H begins busy waiting but since L is never scheduled while H is running, L never gets a chance to leave its critical region, so H loops forever. This is sometimes referred to as the **priority inversion problem**.
